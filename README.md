Steps for executing the code: (All the comments are also properly mentioned inside the code)
1. Go to google colab and upload the file "MeasEval_team7_code.ipynb".
2. Go to "https://github.com/harperco/MeasEval", click on "Code" (highlighted in green) and click on download zip.
3. Go to your Google Drive and inside the "Colab Notebooks" folder, upload the "MeasEval-main.zip" file downloaded in step 3.
4. In the same Google Drive and inside the "Colab Notebooks" folder, manually create a "word_tsv" named folder.
5. Run the first cell only once and then restart the runtime. After restarting the runtime, run from the next cell and onwards (not the first cell).
6. Run the 2nd cell.
7. Then, run the 3rd cell, and click on the link given in output > choose your google drive account > click on allow access to files > copy the code and paste 		it in the output of 3rd cell (use ctrl+v and enter, right click mouse button for paste won't work).
8. Then run the 4th cell and onwards, it should run fine.


All the output tsv files will be saved in "word_tsv" folder created in step 5.
